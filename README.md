# Articles_about_RSA_attacks

In this repository, I will post articles that will be posted on the site <https://yatb.kksctf.ru/> in the future.

This series of articles contains description of mathematical attacks on RSA with various assumptions and scripts in the Sagemath language, that implement the described attacks. 

The files have a hierarchy that is based on the numbers at the beginning of the title of each article - this will make it easier for me to transfer articles to the site in the future.

The articles have links that lead to the site <https://yatb.kksctf.ru/> - later they will be attached to the articles from the "basic concepts" section.
